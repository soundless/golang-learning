 * Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less
 * than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
 * 
 * 
 * You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the
 * two partitions.
 * 
 * 
 * For example,
 * Given 1->4->3->2->5->2 and x = 3,
 * return 1->2->2->4->3->5.
