 *
 * Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path
 * could represent a number.
 * An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number
 * 123.
 * 
 * Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
 * 
 * For example,
 * 
 * ⁠   1
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 2   3
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
 * The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
