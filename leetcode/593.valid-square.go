 *
 * Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space, return whether the four
 * points could construct a square.
 * 
 * The coordinate (x,y) of a point is represented by an integer array with two
 * integers.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
 * Output: True
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ‚Å†Note: 
 * 
 * All the input integers are in the range [-10000, 10000].
 * A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal
 * angles (90-degree angles).
 * Input points have no order.
