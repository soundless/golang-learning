 *
 * Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i
 * and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]
 * 
 * sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
 * sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
 * sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * You may assume that the array does not change.
 * There are many calls to sumRange function.
