package gogo

 * Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while
 * maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
 * 
 * 
 * 

package gogo

 * For example, given nums  = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function,
 * nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
 * Minimize the total number of operations.
 *

 * Credits:Special thanks to @jianchao.li.fighter for adding this problem and
 * creating all test cases.
