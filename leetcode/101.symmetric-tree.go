 *
 * Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric
 * around its center).
 * 
 * 
 * For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
 * 
 * ⁠   1
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 2   2
 * ⁠/ \ / \
 * 3  4 4  3
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]  is not:
 * 
 * ⁠   1
 * ⁠  / \
 * ⁠ 2   2
 * ⁠  \   \
 * ⁠  3    3
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
